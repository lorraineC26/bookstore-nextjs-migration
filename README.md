# aLittleBookstore

This project is a single-page application developed as a frontend developer test for Blazesoft. It utilizes React with Redux and Hooks, along with Next.js for Server Side Rendering, and SCSS for styling.<br/>

It is deployed and accessible at: [https://bookstore-nextjs-migration.vercel.app/](https://bookstore-nextjs-migration.vercel.app/).<br/>
